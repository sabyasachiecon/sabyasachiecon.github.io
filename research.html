The low levels of take-up of sanitation have been largely attributed to the large cost associated with the adoption of such a good. This statement is open to two interpretations. First, the act of building sanitation is a costly investment which necessitates a poor household that is liquidity constrained, to borrow funds to finance its adoption.

I formulate a life-cycle model of sanitation adoption and saving behaviour, incorporating both the presence of liquidity constraints as well as externalities which allows me to distinguish between these two channels. Using a unique dataset on adoption of sanitation from rural India, I address how existing policy interventions that aim to increase sanitation presence in the developing world may or may not meet their target.

              <p>I analyse the impact of strategic interactions on household demand for a preventive healthcare good and on the subsequent welfare effects generated from a subsidy program towards its provision. An interesting feature is that the take-up/consumption of such goods generates positive externalities. In this case, the outcome is such that the privately optimal adoption level is much lower than what the society as a whole would regard as optimal. Using a unique dataset on sanitation take-up from rural India, I formulate and estimate a static interaction model where households make decisions on sanitation adoption, keeping into account the aggregate behaviour of the community to which it belongs. A two-step estimator method is implemented to circumvent the computational burden associated with estimating a model under multiple equilibria. I formulate expressions for Hicksian and Marshallian choice probabilities in the presence of externalities, to separate out the direct and indirect effect of the policy and compute demand elasticities. I use this tool to conduct hypothetical policy simulations for different levels of price and income subsidies, in order to derive conclusions about effective policy design. I find that a significant amount of the policy effect is propagated through the indirect channel. The presence of externalities implies a larger welfare gain, while the deadweight loss generated from the subsidy intervention is realised as a net gain, as the society shifts towards a socially optimal level of adoption.</p>

	    <p> This paper develops a correction method for existing Two-step methods to estimate static discrete choice models of incomplete information. Under the assumption that only one equilibrium is played in the data, two-step estimators avoid the computational burden associated with repeatedly solving the fixed point for each candidate vector of structural parameters. However, the estimator relies on obtaining consistent choice probability estimates in first step, given that observed data is generated from one of possible equilibria. The problem can be treated as one of contamination of the variable of interest by measurement error. Using insights from small variance approximation to probability distributions, I adapt the error correction method proposed by Chesher (1991) to the estimation of simple static interaction models. The method is applied to estimate Brock & Durlauf's (2001) interaction model which has been the cornerstone in the study of peer effects in recent literature. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to approximate the magnitude of the impact of error in data and the resulting bias in parameter estimates.</p>
