              Understanding the effects of population ageing on immigration policies is crucial to assess the long-run sustainability of Public Spending in democratic societies. The existing literature delivers inconsistent predictions about the direction of this relationship because the restrictive assumptions required by the use of Downsian voting models imply that immigration policies had to be analyzed in isolation from public spending and tax policies. I propose a new equilibrium concept that allows an analysis of the interactions among these policy dimensions in a voting model and I suggest a solution to this apparent inconsistency. I show that the political channel may exacerbate the effects of population ageing on Public Finances because of the common interest of the elderly and the poor in limiting immigration and increasing public spending. Finally I show that if income skewness is sufficiently high, then a society would unambiguously benefit from a more open immigration policy in comparison with the level that prevails in the voting equilibrium. The findings are consistent with well-documented empirical patterns in the literature about migration and the predictions of the model about the effects of an increase in life expectancy on immigration and spending policies are conforming to the ones implied by the observed correlations in OECD data.

              The Median Voter Theorem is an extremely popular result in Political Economy that generally holds only if the policy space is unidimensional. This assumption restricts its use to a class of very simple problems. In most applications in the literature this implied an oversimplification of the problem studied, which is one of the possible explanations for the often documented poor empirical performances of the predictions derived with this tool.
In this paper I show that under suitable restrictions on the individuals' capability of committing to policies and on individual preferences a Median Voter Theorem holds even if the policy space is multidimensional and I derive the comparative statics of the equilibrium outcome induced by a change in the voters' distribution.
I show that this tool can invalidate the predictions of the Meltzer-Richard model of size of government and that it can be useful to study other Political Economy problems that cannot be analyzed using the traditional framework, including games in which players have a richer strategy set than the one of simple voting problems.

              Traditional Political Economy models typically imply a strong relationship between income inequality and public intervention in redistributive policies. Empirical evidence suggests that this may hold true only for certain kinds of policies, for instance cash transfers, but in the case of other policies with redistributive effects such as social security and some publicly provided private goods this may not hold true. In this paper I develop a method to derive the sign of the relationship between income inequality and degree of public intervention in education in a Probabilistic Voting model in which the consumers-voters are also allowed to choose other forms of redistribution.
I show that the relationship between income inequality and governmental intervention implied in the traditional literature is mainly a result of the restrictive assumptions of those models. 
I also show that this method can deliver sharp predictions even in presence of those non-convexities in individual preferences that are usually described as a feature induced by public provision of education in the traditional literature in Public Economics. 
This analysis also helps to shed light on the channels that underpin some patterns described in the empirical literature about public intervention in education.
