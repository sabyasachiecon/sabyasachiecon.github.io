        <p> This paper analyses the problem of under-adoption of sanitation and addresses the current policy debate on the choice between loans and price subsidy policies to increase sanitation coverage in the developing world. While sanitation is a expensive investment for a poor potentially liquidity constrained household, adoption also generates positive health externalities for others within the village. Both factors may result in under-adoption but are driven by different sources of market failure. To investigate impact of these two distinct policies on sanitation coverage I estimate a dynamic model of household sanitation demand with interdependent adoption choice, using a unique dataset from rural India. I use the model to compute equilibrium adoption levels under both loans and subsidy policies to study the optimal design of interventions in an equilibrium setting. Counterfactual analysis reveals existing sanitation level to be below the social planner solution, implying under-adoption. I find price subsidies to be more cost effective at increasing sanitation coverage. But the policy effects are heterogeneous with coverage levels, where loans are found to be equally, if not marginally more, effective in villages with no sanitation coverage. A price subsidy has a high social rate of return where the presence of externalities accounts for a substantial fraction of its impact. While a sanitation loan policy generates smaller social returns it is also cost efficient under targeted delivery. </p>

              <!--p> This paper analyses the key barriers towards improved sanitation coverage at the household level in the developing world. The low levels of take-up of sanitation have been largely attributed to the large cost associated with the adoption of such a good. This statement is open to two interpretations. First, the act of building sanitation is a costly investment which necessitates a poor household that is liquidity constrained, to borrow funds to finance its adoption. Second, though the cost of adoption of sanitation is privately incurred, the returns realised to the household also depend on the actions of its fellow community members, indicating the presence of externalities. Both phenomenon justify the presence of public intervention to improve sanitation coverage. However, they both arise from two distinct sources of market failures, and as such require a different design of policy interventions. I formulate a life-cycle model of sanitation adoption and saving behaviour, incorporating both the presence of liquidity constraints as well as externalities which allows me to distinguish between these two channels. Using a unique dataset on adoption of sanitation from rural India, I address how existing policy interventions that aim to increase sanitation presence in the developing world may or may not meet their target. The estimates show that the presence of externalities is especially important in explaining household adoption behaviour. Simulations indicate that price subsidies and village level subsidies would stimulate adoption within a village at a much lower cost than provision of individual household loans. </p-->  
              <!--p>I analyse the impact of strategic interactions on household demand for a preventive healthcare good and on the subsequent welfare effects generated from a subsidy program towards its provision. An interesting feature is that the take-up/consumption of such goods generates positive externalities. In this case, the outcome is such that the privately optimal adoption level is much lower than what the society as a whole would regard as optimal. Using a unique dataset on sanitation take-up from rural India, I formulate and estimate a static interaction model where households make decisions on sanitation adoption, keeping into account the aggregate behaviour of the community to which it belongs. A two-step estimator method is implemented to circumvent the computational burden associated with estimating a model under multiple equilibria. I formulate expressions for Hicksian and Marshallian choice probabilities in the presence of externalities, to separate out the direct and indirect effect of the policy and compute demand elasticities. I use this tool to conduct hypothetical policy simulations for different levels of price and income subsidies, in order to derive conclusions about effective policy design. I find that a significant amount of the policy effect is propagated through the indirect channel. The presence of externalities implies a larger welfare gain, while the deadweight loss generated from the subsidy intervention is realised as a net gain, as the society shifts towards a socially optimal level of adoption.</p-->
		<p>This paper analyses the impact of externalities on household demand for a preventive healthcare good and the subsequent welfare effects generated from a subsidy program towards its provision. An interesting feature of such goods is that the take-up generates externalities where the privately chosen adoption level differs from what is socially optimal. Using a unique dataset on sanitation take-up from rural India, I estimate a static demand model keeping into account the interdependence of household decision making within the village. A two-step estimation method is implemented to circumvent the computational burden associated with estimating a model with multiple equilibria. To evaluate the impact of subsidy interventions, I formulate analytical expressions to quantify substitution and income effects in the presence of externalities. Using this tool to further separate out the direct and indirect effects under different policy simulations, I find that substitution effects are significantly larger than income effects, and a substantial amount of this price effect between 41% − 86% is propagated through the indirect channel. The pres- ence of positive externalities implies a larger welfare gain, while the Deadweight loss generated from the subsidy intervention is realised as a Net-Gain, as the society shifts towards a socially optimal level of adoption.</p>	</div>

		    <p>A large literature has examined the impact of cash and in-kind transfers on consumption in developing countries. In evaluating these programs, however, existing work has mostly ignored households’ subsistence or liquidity constraints; the dispersion in the unit prices of even the most common staples; the impact of transfers on this price dispersion; and the non-pecuniary (real) and pecuniary (price) indirect effects of transfers on both eligible and non-eligible households in communities targeted by these programs. In this paper, we complement the existing literature in all of these dimensions. Namely, we first develop an equilibrium model to estimate the impact of transfers on consumption, consumer welfare, and the nonlinearity of prices accounting for households’ heterogeneous preferences and subsistence or liquidity constraints, and to measure the potential spillover effects of transfers on eligible and non-eligible households. We then examine the optimal design of transfers in the presence of the spillover effects we measure. </p>

		    <p> This paper analyses the marriage decisions of men and women, focusing on the added attractiveness of sanitation within the living arrangement, in rural India. We exploit district and time variation from the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) which increased sanitation by 6.6 percent among households with marriage eligible children and generated an exogenous increase in the composition of households with sanitation.  Using data from the Indian Human Development household survey (IHDS) and district level census, we show that exposure to TSC increased the probability of marriage for men and women, from poorer households, by 3.8 pp and 6.5 pp respectively. The reduced form estimates incorporate both general equilibrium effects and heterogeneous program effects – two important components of equilibrium marital behavior. To decompose the overall policy impact on marriage market equilibrium we formulate a simple matching model where men and women match on observed and unobserved characteristics. Through model simulations, we show that cohorts within TSC exposed markets experienced a shift in marital gains both across matches but also within a given match. Specifically, the resultant sorting patterns display a marked gender asymmetry with an increase in marital surplus among matches where men are wealthier than their spouse, and a decrease in surplus where the wife is wealthier. Moreover, the increased access to sanitation for TSC exposed women implied a decline in their expected control over resources within the marriage. </p>
	<!--p>This paper quantifies the expected marriage market returns for sanitation investments in rural India. The coveted marital status, specially for women, combined with a strong preference for own caste and location prompt many Indian households, looking for a ’suitable’ match, to undertake premarital investments in their marriage eligible children. We take a structural approach to analyse the role of marriage markets in one such investment, household sanitation decisions across rural India. First, we use quasi-random variation from the nation wide Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) policy to identify the household investment response to local marriage market conditions e.g. shortages of women. Next, to quantify the marital return on sanitation, termed "marital premium" and to decompose the policy impact on marital sorting we estimate a simple matching model under transferable utility (Choo and Siow 2006) where men and women match on their wealth type. The model is estimated using data from the IHDS household survey panel and district level census data to account for equilibrium marital sorting i.e., whether individuals find a match and with whom. We find that marriage markets matter. Changes in male and female expected gain from marriage post exposure to TSC are attributed to marriage market conditions. However there is substantial heterogeneity in policy impact where increase in total expected surplus and female share is limited to wealthier households. </p-->

	    <p> This paper develops a correction method for existing Two-step CCP methods to estimate static and dynamic discrete choice models of incomplete information. Under the assumption that the observed data is generated by one of the possible equilibria, two-step estimators avoid the computational burden associated with repeatedly solving the fixed point for each candidate vector of parameters. However, to obtain consistent choice probability estimates in the first stage, two-step estimators rely on being able to observe the entire vector of states and actions in the data. This data limitation can be treated as a contamination of the variable of interest with measurement error. Using insights from small variance approximation to probability distributions, I extend the error correction method proposed by Chesher (1991) to the estimation of simple static interaction models. The method is applied to estimate Brock & Durlauf's (2001) interaction model which has been the cornerstone in the study of peer effects in recent literature. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to approximate the magnitude of the impact of error in data and the resulting bias in parameter estimates. </p>
